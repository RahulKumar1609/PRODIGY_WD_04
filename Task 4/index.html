      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Rahul Kumar, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end development and user interface design.</p>
      <p>I completed my B.Tech degree with a stellar 9.8 CGPA from [Your University/School]. During my academic journey, I focused on mastering web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Vue.js.</p>
      <p>I have hands-on experience in developing responsive and interactive web applications. Some of my notable projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> Description of Project 1. Nav Bar: A responsive navigation menu that changes color and style when scrolled or hovered over, enhancing user experience and accessibility across different devices.</li>

        <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> Clock: A stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes functionalities for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times</li>

        <li><strong>Project 3:</strong> Description of Project 3.Tic-Tac-Toe Game: An interactive web application developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play tic-tac-toe against each other, featuring game logic to handle user clicks, track game state, and determine winning conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in web development to deliver innovative solutions.</p>
